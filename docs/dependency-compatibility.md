## Known Compatibility Notes

### React 19.1
- ✅ Works with Tauri 2.x (verified in window.rs and commands.rs)
- ✅ Zustand integration stable
- ✅ React Testing Library fully compatible
- ⚠️ Some older third-party packages may not support React 19 yet (not applicable to this project)

### Tailwind 4
- ✅ Using v4 pre-release (@tailwindcss/postcss)
- ✅ No breaking changes since initial integration
- ✅ PostCSS pipeline working correctly
- 📌 Will upgrade to stable v4 release when available (likely Q4 2024)

### Vitest 3
- ✅ Coverage with v8 provider working
- ✅ All mocks (AudioContext, getUserMedia) functioning
- ✅ Test timeouts configured appropriately
- ✅ Parallel test execution stable

### Playwright 1.48
- ✅ Chromium backend working
- ✅ Config with Vite dev server integration
- ✅ Screenshots and traces generating correctly
- ✅ No known breaking changes

### Tauri 2.x
- ✅ Rust command handlers functional
- ✅ Window management APIs working
- ✅ File system APIs accessible
- ✅ Permission system functioning

## Dependency Upgrade Strategy

### Pre-Release Versions (Tailwind 4)
- **Current**: Using pre-release build
- **Upgrade Trigger**: When v4 stable releases
- **Testing Required**:
  1. Run full test suite
  2. Verify no CSS changes
  3. Check for breaking API changes
  4. Build for production
- **Timeline**: Before Phase 15 release

### Major Version Updates (React, Tauri, Vite)
- **Process**:
  1. Check release notes for breaking changes
  2. Run `npm update` in test branch
  3. Run full CI pipeline
  4. Manual testing of critical flows
  5. Merge if all pass
- **Frequency**: Quarterly review
- **Stability**: Only after patch versions released

### Minor/Patch Updates
- **Process**: Automatic via Dependabot (recommended)
- **Policy**: Auto-merge if CI passes
- **Exceptions**: Security patches (merge immediately)

## Vulnerability Scan

```bash
npm audit
# Last run: 2025-10-27
# Vulnerabilities: 0
# Status: ✅ No security issues
```

---

## Lock File Management

```
package-lock.json: Committed to version control ✅
Prevents dependency drift across environments ✅
Ensures deterministic builds ✅
```

---

## CI/CD Integration

The following CI checks verify dependency compatibility:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- type-check: Ensures TypeScript types resolve correctly
- lint: Verifies no peer dependency conflicts
- test: Runs full test suite with all dependencies
- build: Builds Tauri app and verifies output
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Module not found" errors
```bash
# Solution: Clean and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### TypeScript compilation errors
```bash
# Solution: Verify type definitions
npm run type-check
# Check tsconfig.json matches Node version
```

### Test failures with dependencies
```bash
# Solution: Ensure setup.ts loads correctly
npm run test -- --inspect-brk
# Check vitest.config.ts globalSetup path
```

### Build failures
```bash
# Solution: Clear Tauri cache
cargo clean
npm run build
```

## Pre-Release Version Policy

**Policy**: Using pre-release versions is acceptable for:
1. Educational/internal projects
2. When upstream library is actively maintained
3. When core functionality is stable (not volatile APIs)

**For Tailwind 4**: Acceptable because:
- PostCSS integration is stable
- CSS output is backward-compatible
- Minor syntax changes only

**For Production Release (Phase 15)**:
- Upgrade Tailwind to stable release
- Run full regression testing
- Update this document
