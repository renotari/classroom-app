# Risk Mitigation Strategy

Based on external code review (2025-10-24), three strategic risks were identified and mitigated.

## Risk 1: Unclear Roadmap Execution

**Status**: Medium Risk â†’ Low Risk (Mitigated)

### Problem
Documentation promised 15 phases, but only Timer (Phase 3) was real. Rest were placeholders.

### Mitigation
- âœ… **Synchronize Docs**: README, PROJECT_PLAN.md, CLAUDE.md now reflect actual Phase 4 completion
- âœ… **Freeze Roadmap**: Explicit feature freeze decision: Phases 1-9 are core MVP, 10-11 optional
- âœ… **Update Cadence**: Documentation updates after every major phase completion (see workflow-checklist.md)
- ðŸ”„ **Monitoring**: Every 2 weeks, audit docs against actual implementation

**Responsible**: Project Lead
**Review Cadence**: End of each phase
**Success Metric**: README accuracy verified by team before releasing phase

## Risk 2: Lack of Automated Tests Beyond Timer

**Status**: Medium Risk â†’ Low Risk (Mitigated)

### Problem
Only Timer had unit tests. Audio, Noise, Class modules had no test infrastructure.

### Mitigation
- âœ… **Test Infrastructure Scaffolded**:
  - Skeleton tests created for Phase 5 (noiseMonitorService.test.ts)
  - Skeleton tests created for Phase 9 (groupGenerationService.test.ts)
  - Store testing patterns documented in `src/tests/unit/stores/README.md`
- âœ… **Test Patterns Documented**: Full testing guide in `docs/testing-comprehensive-guide.md`
  - Unit test patterns (hooks, services, stores)
  - Integration test patterns
  - E2E test patterns with Playwright
  - Coverage targets: >70% per module
- âœ… **CI/CD Ready**: Vitest configured with coverage reporting

**Responsible**: Every developer implementing Phase 5+
**Review Cadence**: Each phase must include tests (required for "complete" status)
**Success Metric**: >70% coverage maintained, all phases tested before merge

## Risk 3: Widening Gap Between Specs and Implementation

**Status**: Medium Risk â†’ Low Risk (Mitigated)

### Problem
Technical spec documents existed but disconnected from actual code. Feature flags marked phase "complete" while placeholders remained.

### Mitigation
- âœ… **Feature Flag Semantics Defined**:
  - Phase marked "complete" (flag=true) only when:
    1. All required features implemented
    2. All unit tests passing (>70% coverage)
    3. All edge cases handled
    4. No placeholder components remain
    5. Ready for integration
- âœ… **Spec Cross-References**:
  - Every store skeleton includes reference to spec document
  - Every test skeleton includes reference to edge cases doc
  - CLAUDE.md includes explicit links to `docs/` for architecture decisions
- âœ… **Edge Case Tracking**:
  - All 15 edge cases documented in PROJECT_PLAN.md
  - Each assigned to specific phase
  - Status tracked (RESOLVED, PENDING, SCHEDULED)
- âœ… **Documentation Sync Checklist** (added to workflow):
  - After phase completion, update:
    - README.md (roadmap table, features list)
    - PROJECT_PLAN.md (phase status, metrics)
    - CLAUDE.md (if architectural changes)
    - Feature flags (phase completion decision)

**Responsible**: Lead on each phase
**Review Cadence**: Before committing any phase
**Success Metric**: Specs and code stay in sync (<1 week drift max)

## Risk Review Schedule

### Every 2 Weeks
- [ ] Review risk status (Risk 1, 2, 3 above)
- [ ] Check documentation sync (is docs <1 week behind code?)
- [ ] Audit test coverage (is it trending toward >70%?)
- [ ] Identify new risks or blockers

### End of Each Phase
- [ ] Complete documentation sync checklist (see workflow-checklist.md)
- [ ] Re-assess all three strategic risks
- [ ] Update this document if status changed

### Before Release (Phase 15)
- [ ] Full documentation audit: specs vs. actual code
- [ ] Verify all 15 edge cases resolved or explicitly deferred
- [ ] Test coverage report: show >70% coverage
- [ ] Performance baseline: <100MB RAM, <5% CPU idle

## Success Criteria for Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1 (Roadmap) - MITIGATED
- âœ… Docs synchronized monthly
- âœ… Phases have clear "complete" criteria

### Risk 2 (Testing) - MITIGATED
- âœ… Test scaffolding in place
- âœ… Patterns documented
- âœ… >70% coverage on-track for completion

### Risk 3 (Specs) - MITIGATED
- âœ… Feature flags enforce spec compliance
- âœ… Edge cases tracked and assigned
- âœ… Specs cross-referenced in code

### Overall Assessment
From "High Risk" project to "Low Risk" with these mitigations. **Monitor quarterly**.

---

## Monitoring Tools

### Documentation Sync Check
```bash
# Compare README vs PROJECT_PLAN phases
grep "COMPLETATA" README.md
grep "Status: COMPLETATA" PROJECT_PLAN.md

# Should match exactly
```

### Test Coverage Audit
```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Check coverage percentage
cat coverage/coverage-summary.json | grep "pct"

# Target: >70% across all metrics
```

### Edge Case Status
```bash
# Check edge case tracking in PROJECT_PLAN.md
grep "EC-00" PROJECT_PLAN.md

# Verify status: RESOLVED, PENDING, or SCHEDULED
```

## Escalation Path

### When to Escalate

**Escalate to Project Lead** if:
- Documentation drift exceeds 1 week
- Test coverage drops below 60%
- Critical edge case (EC-000 to EC-004) remains unresolved past scheduled phase
- Feature flag marked complete but criteria not met

**Escalate to Team** if:
- New strategic risk identified
- Mitigation strategy failing (success metrics not met)
- Timeline slippage >2 weeks

### Response Times
- **Critical risks**: Address within 24 hours
- **Important risks**: Address within 1 week
- **Nice-to-have**: Address within current phase
